# AD-Entra-Hybrid-Lab
Windows Server 2019 Active Directory lab with Azure Entra ID hybrid sync using PowerShell, GPO, and Azure AD Connect.


# Hybrid Active Directory + Entra ID Lab

This project began as a personal lab to learn on-prem Active Directory, based on [Josh Madakor's YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsI8hJmggI). It evolved into a full hybrid identity setup using Microsoft Entra ID and Azure AD Connect. I implemented a real-world domain sync, resolved domain verification issues, and manually configured the sync between on-prem and cloud identities.

## üìö What This Lab Covers

- Windows Server 2019 installation and AD DS setup
- PowerShell automation to create 1,000 users and multiple OUs
- DHCP and DNS configuration
- Domain join for two client machines (VirtualBox)
- Group Policy creation and enforcement (password complexity, lock screen timeout)
- Azure domain verification via GoDaddy DNS
- Installing and configuring Microsoft Entra Connect
- User sync to Microsoft Entra ID

## üß™ Lab Setup & Steps

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: On-Prem AD Setup

- Installed Windows Server 2019
- Added AD DS, DHCP, and DNS server roles
- Promoted to Domain Controller with internal domain
- Created 1,000 users with PowerShell
- Built OUs for departments, devices, locations (IT, HR, etc.)
- Applied GPOs: lock screen timeout, password complexity
- Domain-joined two Windows 10 clients via VirtualBox

### üîÅ Phase 2: Hybrid Identity with Entra ID

- Ran into domain verification issues (original test domain couldn‚Äôt sync)
- Purchased a real domain: `IDSentinelSolutions.com` via GoDaddy
- Configured DNS TXT record and verified in Microsoft Entra
- Created a new AD environment with the verified domain
- Installed and configured Entra Connect on a separate VM
- Successfully synced AD users to Entra ID cloud environment

## üîÑ Lab Evolution & Lessons Learned

Initially, I set up a lab using a made-up domain for Active Directory testing. After getting DHCP, DNS, users, and clients working, I planned to sync with Azure but hit a roadblock: **Azure AD Connect requires domain ownership verification**, and my original test domain couldn't be verified.

### What I did to fix it:
- Registered a real domain: `IDSentinelSolutions.com`
- Verified the domain in Microsoft Entra (Azure AD)
- Rebuilt the AD lab environment using the verified domain
- Configured Azure AD Connect manually and completed sync

### What I learned:
- How UPN suffixes and verified domains impact hybrid identity
- How to set up AD for real-world use, not just isolated labs
- That troubleshooting sync issues requires understanding DNS, UPNs, and Azure identity architecture
- The importance of using real scenarios to gain hands-on experience

---

## üí° What I Added Beyond the Video

- Used a **real, owned domain** and updated DNS for Azure verification
- Rebuilt a full AD environment to support verified sync
- Configured and verified Azure AD Connect manually
- Connected two Windows 10 clients and tested AD policies
- Planning to add Conditional Access and SSPR as next steps
